Now that we have a general direction. The next question is.. where is the next clue ?

![](images/tasks.png)

Now, we know exactly which version of PWN we're running and there's no exploit available  in the wild for pwm v2.03

Awesome,  we've made progress.. and now how do we decrypt it ? 

 I found this two resources online that were useful
https://www.bengrewell.com/cracking-ansible-vault-secrets-with-hashcat/
https://ppn.snovvcrash.rocks/pentest/infrastructure/devops/ansible

We extracted the vaults blob containing the encrypted password and cracked the secret AES key using john.

```sh
ansible2john pwd.vault | tee pwd.hash
```
```sh
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Â pwd.hash
```

	AES Decryption Key: !@#$%^&*

![](images/secret_key.png)

We need to install ansible to get access to the ansible-vault command
```sh
sudo apt install -y ansible 
```

And we've compromised a login using the secret key!
```
username: svc_pwm
password: pWm_@dm!N_!23
```

Now have access to pwm's config editor!

_We got some bad news! svc_pwm is not a domain user_

![](images/kerberos.png)

However, now we have access to pwm admins interface. Let's see what we can do

![](images/sensitivy.png)

We download the xml file and found a mention to  user svc_ldap and a encrypted password.

![](images/svc_ldap.png)

Good news svc_ldap is a domain user! we're getting closer to our first objective!

![](images/goodnews.png)

More good news, there's a weird ass comment on the xml file that says that we can force the document to be generated containing credentials in clear text by adding a new
property key!  

![](images/question.png)

Let's try this   

```
<property key="storePlaintextValues">true</property>
```
![](images/question2.png)

Now we upload the modified configuration file.  

![](images/upload.png)

Oh my goodness it worked!!

![](images/clear.png)

```
username: svc_ldap@authority.htb
password: lDaP_1n_th3_cle4r!
```


Let us test it

```sh
smbmap -d authority.htb \
	-u svc_ldap \
	-p 'lDaP_1n_th3_cle4r!' \
	-H authority.authority.htb
```

Perfect, we got the objective 1 and now we also have access to the "Department Shares"
