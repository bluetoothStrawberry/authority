Now that we have a general direction. The next question is.. where is the next clue ?

Now, we know exactly which version of PWN we're running. and there's no exploit available  in the wild for pwm v2.03

Awesome,  we've made progress.. and now how do we decrypt it ? 

 I found this two resources online that were useful
https://www.bengrewell.com/cracking-ansible-vault-secrets-with-hashcat/
https://ppn.snovvcrash.rocks/pentest/infrastructure/devops/ansible

We extracted the vaults blob containing the encrypted password and cracked the secret AES key using john.

```sh
ansible2john pwd.vault | tee pwd.hash
```
```sh
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Â pwd.hash
```

	AES Decryption Key: !@#$%^&*

We need to install ansible to get access to the ansible-vault command
```sh
sudo apt install -y ansible 
```

And we've compromised a login using the secret key!
```
username: svc_pwm@authority.htb
password: pWm_@dm!N_!23
```

Now have access to pwm's config editor!

How about the ldap admin vault ?

_We got some bad news! svc_pwm is not a domain user_

However, now we have access to pwm admins interface. Let's see what we can do
